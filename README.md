## Usage 
- Delta Robot safety is also understood in various ways, including preventing the automation from damaging its environment, notably the human involvement of that surroundings, and easily preventing injury to the robot itself. while not correct precautions, a robot experiencing a fault or failure can cause serious injuries to people and injury equipment in or around a work cell More clear instructions are available in the https://github.com/ariharasudhanm/Design-of-Delta-Robot/blob/9478849ddac64937d7daad748451efada0b2e517/Ariharasudhan_Muthusami.pdf in the Requirements of work safety and  environment.

- This is the breakpoint graph as an economical estimator that estimates the treshold number of sales to yield profit.

### Features
- Belt actuation method is chosen because it has low mass inertia and it can produce high caliber of torque support so reducing one arm which reduces a joint, by this moment can be reduced,which can be used for higher payloads of 2 kg by maintaining medium accuracy of ±0.2 mm.
- Belt actuation method is chosen because it has low mass inertia and it can produce high caliber of torque support so reducing one arm which reduces a joint, by this moment can be reduced, which can be used for higher payloads of 2 kg by maintaining medium accuracy of ±0.2 mm.
- From economical calculations mechanical parts contributes 80% of the total cost for producing the device which is comparatively higher than electrical components but repairing costs of mechanical components when compared to replacement of electrical components is cheap and efficient way and breakpoint occurs at 422 units.


### Content
It is a parallel kind of manipulators in which several links connected in the closed kinematic chain where the articulated traveling plate is attached to the bottom of link in a common type of parallel manipulator called Delta robots, but there are several modified Delta robots which provide 3,4,6 DOF according to their orientation of linkages. These types of robots which are getting popular now-a-days because of their high acceleration due to low inertia, high stability and precision due to multiple ties connecting articulated traveling plate, these types of robots used in pick and place
operations of lightweight materials, medicinal packaging, micro-electronics assemblies, and parallel manipulators have several advantages over serial kind of manipulators like acceleration and high stiffness, high repeatability more in https://github.com/ariharasudhanm/Design-of-Delta-Robot/blob/9478849ddac64937d7daad748451efada0b2e517/Ariharasudhan_Muthusami.pdf in the Introduction.


### Requirements
After checking the specified combination of the robot and controller, connect the robot and controller. Always shut off all levels of the energy supply externally before starting installation or wiring work failure to do this could cause electric surprise, or product damage Do not apply excessive impacts or loads to the connectors whilst making cable connections this could bend the connector pins or damage the inner C board. More in https://github.com/ariharasudhanm/Design-of-Delta-Robot/blob/9478849ddac64937d7daad748451efada0b2e517/Ariharasudhan_Muthusami.pdf in 7.3 Wiring safety section.

### Limitations
- There is no any autonomous gripper is used since, it was assumed to have vaccum gripper and its techincal features are considered for the vaccum based gripper, but it is not very efficient to implement in the field so, in the future we have plans to integrate vision based picking grippers.
